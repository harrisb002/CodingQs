# Program Spec: Given two sorted linked lists
# Write a program to return the intersections of the linked lists
# Need to return the head pointer of the new linked list
# Both linked lists have no cycle
# If there is no common element, then return NULL
# Do not change the structure of the linked lists
# Input: list1 = 2 -> 9 -> 13 -> 20 -> 22 -> 27 -> NULL
#        list2 = 2 -> 4 -> 9 -> 20 -> 27 -> NULL
# Output: 2 -> 9 -> 20 -> 27 -> NULL
# Exp: 2, 9, 20, and 27 are the common nodes to both linked lists
