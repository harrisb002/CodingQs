# Program Spec: Write a program to find the length of the longest substring without repetition
# Substring is a continuous sub-part of the string, where we aim to determine the maximum
# Substring which has all unique characters.
# Input string consists of English letters, digits, and symbols
# The answer must be continuous substring, not a subsequence of the string
# There can be more than one longest substring of equal length, thus return only length.
# Input: str = "abcbbcab" -> Output = 1
# Exp: There are three substrings of unique chars with the longest length 3
# Input: str = "bbbbb" -> Output = 1
# Exp: There is only one unique char
# Input: str = "enjoyalgorithms" -> Output: 11\
# Exp: "o" is the only repeated char so "yalgorithms" is the answer
