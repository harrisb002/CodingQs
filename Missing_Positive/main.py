# Program Spec: Given an array that includes positive and negative numbers
# Write a program to find the smallest missing positive integer
# Input: X[] = [2,-9,5,11,1,-10,7] -> Output: 3
# Explain -> Consecutive pos. int. 1 and 2 are present, so first missing pos. is 3
# Input: X[] = [4,6,5,3,8] -> Output: 1
# Explain -> All values are pos. but the first pos. int. 1 is missing
